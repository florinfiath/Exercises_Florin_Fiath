        <h3>Serif Typefaces</h3>
        <p>We are trying out the IBM Plex Serif Typeface</p>
        <p>
          Serif typefaces are called “serifs” in reference to the small lines
          that are attached to the main strokes of characters within the face.
          Serif typefaces are most often used for body copy in print documents,
          as well as for both body text and headlines online. The readability of
          serifs online has been debated, and some designers prefer not to use
          serifs for large blocks of copy.

        <h3>Sans-Serif Typeface</h3>
        <p>We are trying out the Arial Sans-Serif typeface</p>
        <p>
          Sans-serif typefaces are called such because they lack serif details
          on characters. Sans-serif typefaces are often more modern in
          appearance than serifs. The first sans-serifs were created in the late
          18th century.

        <h3>Script Typeface</h3>
        <p>We are trying out the Arial Sans-Serif typeface</p>
        <p>
          Scripts are based upon handwriting, and offer very fluid letter forms.
          There are two basic classifications: formal and casual. Formal scripts
          are often reminiscent of the handwritten letter forms common in the
          17th and 18th centuries.

        <h3>Monospace Typeface</h3>
        <p>We are trying out the Space Mono monospace typeface</p>
        <p>
          In monospace typefaces, on the other hand, each character takes up the
          same amount of space. Narrower characters simply get a bit more
          spacing around them to make up for the difference in width.

        <h3>Display Typeface</h3>
        <p>We are trying out the Averia Serif Libre display typeface</p>
        <p>
          Display typefaces are probably the broadest category and include the
          most variation. The main characteristic is that they’re unsuitable for
          body copy and are best reserved for headlines or other short copy that
          needs attention drawn to it. Display typefaces can be formal, or
          informal, and evoke any kind of mood. They’re more commonly seen in
          print design, but are becoming more popular online with the use of web
          fonts.
