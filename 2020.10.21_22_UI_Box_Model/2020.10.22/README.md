1. Create a web page that clearly defines:
    - header (with a green-like background);
    - main content;
    - footer (with a black-background;

2. For the main content, define a container (like we saw today, code is in #lessons) that expands at most to 960px (padding included);
4. For the header and footer define a container that expands at most to 1180px (padding included);
5. Expand the main content to take full height of your page;
6. In the main content, paste the box-model we designed yesterday, and add some text about the box-model;
7. Remember to add a main heading;

Optional: header
Using the best technique you know, add an image of your choice to the left side of the header and 5 "menu-items" (e.g: menu-1, menu-2, menu-3, ...) to the right side of it;

Additional content for the footer:
Add the text "Links to social media" to the left side and "Copyright notice" to the right side:
With padding, make the footer be at least 100px in height.
