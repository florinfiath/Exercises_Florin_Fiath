    <h2 id="kingdom">Kingdom of Norway</h2>
    <p>
      Norway, officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a Nordic country in Northern
      Europe whose mainland territory comprises the western and northernmost
      portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula; Mainland Norway and the remote
      island of Jan Mayen as well as the archipelago of Svalbard form
      Metropolitan Norway.[note 1] Bouvet Island, located in the Subantarctic,
      is a dependency of the Kingdom of Norway. Norway also lays claims to the
      Antarctic territories of Peter I Island and Queen Maud Land.

      <a href="https://www.visitoslo.com/de/" target="_blank" title="See the Capital of Norway"><strong>Oslo</strong></a
      >,the capital, most populous, and primate city of Norway. It constitutes
      both a county and a municipality. As of 27 February 2020, the municipality
      of Oslo had a population of 693,491, while the population of the city's
      urban area of 4 November 2019 was 1,019,513.The metropolitan area had an
      estimated population of 1.71 million.[14] During the Viking Age the area
      was part of Viken. Oslo was founded as a city at the end of the Viking Age
      in the year 1040 under the name Ánslo, and established as a kaupstad or
      trading place in 1048 by Harald Hardrada. The city was elevated to a
      bishopric in 1070 and a capital under Haakon V of Norway around 1300.
      Personal unions with Denmark from 1397 to 1523 and again from 1536 to 1814
      reduced its influence. After being destroyed by a fire in 1624, during the
      reign of King Christian IV, a new city was built closer to Akershus
      Fortress and named Christiania in the king's honour. It was established as
      a municipality (formannskapsdistrikt) on 1 January 1838. The city
      functioned as the capital of Norway during the 1814–1905 union between
      Sweden and Norway. From 1877, the city's name was spelled Kristiania in
      government usage, a spelling that was adopted by the municipal authorities
      only in 1897. In 1925 the city, after incorporating the village retaining
      its former name, was renamed Oslo. In 1948 Oslo merged with Aker, a
      municipality which surrounded the capital and which was 27 times larger,
      thus creating the modern, vastly enlarged Oslo municipality. f Oslo is the
      economic and governmental centre of Norway. The city is also a hub of
      Norwegian trade, banking, industry and shipping. It is an important centre
      for maritime industries and maritime trade in Europe. The city is home to
      many companies within the maritime sector, some of which are among the
      world's largest shipping companies, shipbrokers and maritime insurance
      brokers. Oslo is a pilot city of the Council of Europe and the European
      Commission intercultural cities programme. Oslo is considered a global
      city and was ranked "Beta World City" in studies carried out by the
      Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network in 2008. It was
      ranked number one in terms of quality of life among European large cities
      in the European Cities of the Future 2012 report by fDi magazine. A survey
      conducted by ECA International in 2011 placed Oslo as the second most
      expensive city in the world for living expenses after Tokyo. In 2013 Oslo
      tied with the Australian city of Melbourne as the fourth most expensive
      city in the world, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU)'s
      Worldwide Cost of Living study.[18] Oslo was ranked as the 24th most
      liveable city in the world by Monocle magazine.[19] Oslo’s population was
      increasing at record rates during the early 2000s, making it the fastest
      growing major city in Europe at the time.[20] This growth stems for the
      most part from international immigration and related high birth rates, but
      also from intra-national migration. The immigrant population in the city
      is growing somewhat faster than the Norwegian population,[21] and in the
      city proper this is now more than 25% of the total population if immigrant
      parents are included.

        >Norway</a
      >
      has two official names: Norge in Bokmål and Noreg in Nynorsk. The English
      name Norway comes from the Old English word Norþweg mentioned in 880,
      meaning "northern way" or "way leading to the north", which is how the
      Anglo-Saxons referred to the coastline of Atlantic Norway[25][26] similar
      to scientific consensus about the origin of the Norwegian language
      name.[27] The Anglo-Saxons of Britain also referred to the kingdom of
      Norway in 880 as Norðmanna land.[25][26] There is some disagreement about
      whether the native name of Norway originally had the same etymology as the
      English form. According to the traditional dominant view, the first
      component was originally norðr, a cognate of English north, so the full
      name was Norðr vegr, "the way northwards", referring to the sailing route
      along the Norwegian coast, and contrasting with suðrvegar "southern way"
      (from Old Norse suðr) for (Germany), and austrvegr "eastern way" (from
      austr) for the Baltic. In the translation of Orosius for Alfred, the name
      is Norðweg, while in younger Old English sources the ð is gone.[28] In the
      10th century many Norsemen settled in Northern France, according to the
      sagas, in the area that was later called Normandy from norðmann (Norseman
      or Scandinavian[29][30]), although not a Norwegian possession.[31] In
      France normanni or northmanni referred to people of Norway, Sweden or
      Denmark.[32] Until around 1800 inhabitants of Western Norway were referred
      to as nordmenn (northmen) while inhabitants of Eastern Norway were
      referred to as austmenn (eastmen).[33] According to another theory, the
      first component was a word nór, meaning "narrow" (Old English nearu) or
      "northern", referring to the inner-archipelago sailing route through the
      land ("narrow way"). The interpretation as "northern", as reflected in the
      English and Latin forms of the name, would then have been due to later
      folk etymology. This latter view originated with philologist Niels
      Halvorsen Trønnes in 1847; since 2016 it as also advocated by language
      student and activist Klaus Johan Myrvoll and was adopted by philology
      professor Michael Schulte.[25][26] The form Nore is still used in
      placenames such as the village of Nore and lake Norefjorden in Buskerud
      county, and still has the same meaning.[25][26] Among other arguments in
      favour of the theory, it is pointed out that the word has a long vowel in
      Skaldic poetry and is not attested with <ð> in any native Norse texts or
      inscriptions (the earliest runic attestations have the spellings nuruiak
      and nuriki). This resurrecte<h3>On this page:</h3>

    </ul>d theory has received some pushback by other
      scholars on various grounds, e. g. the uncontroversial presence of the
      element norðr in the ethnonym norðrmaðr "Norseman, Norwegian person"
      (modern Norwegian nordmann), and the adjective norrǿnn "northern, Norse,
      Norwegian", as well as the very early attestations of the Latin and
      Anglo-Saxon forms with ! .[28][26] In a Latin manuscript of 849, the name
      Northuagia is mentioned, while a French chronicle of c. 900 uses the names
      Northwegia and Norwegia.[34] When Ohthere of Hålogaland visited King
      Alfred the Great in England in the end of the ninth century, the land was
      called Norðwegr (lit. "Northway") and norðmanna land (lit. "Northmen's
      land").[34] According to Ohthere, Norðmanna lived along the Atlantic
      coast, the Danes around Skagerrak og Kattegat, while the Sámi people (the
      "Fins") had a nomadic lifestyle in the wide interior.[35][36] Ohthere told
      Alfred that he was "the most northern of all Norwegians", presumably at
      Senja island or closer to Tromsø. He also said that beyond the wide
      wilderness in Norway's southern part was the land of the Swedes,
      "Svealand".[37][38] The adjective Norwegian, recorded from c. 1600, is
      derived from the latinisation of the name as Norwegia; in the adjective
      Norwegian, the Old English spelling '-weg' has survived.[39] After Norway
      had become Christian, Noregr and Noregi had become the most common forms,
      but during the 15th century, the newer forms Noreg(h) and Norg(h)e, found
      in medieval Icelandic manuscripts, took over and have survived until the
      modern day.[citation needed]

      The first inhabitants were the Ahrensburg culture (11th to 10th millennia
      BC), which was a late Upper Paleolithic culture during the Younger Dryas,
      the last period of cold at the end of the Weichselian glaciation. The
      culture is named after the village of Ahrensburg, 25 km (15.53 mi)
      north-east of Hamburg in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein, where
      wooden arrow shafts and clubs have been excavated.[40] The earliest traces
      of human occupation in Norway are found along the coast, where the huge
      ice shelf of the last ice age first melted between 11,000 and 8,000 BC.
      The oldest finds are stone tools dating from 9,500 to 6,000 BC, discovered
      in Finnmark <span class="color-hover">Komsa culture</span>,in the north
      and Rogaland (Fosna culture) in the south-west. However, theories about
      two altogether different cultures (the Komsa culture north of the Arctic
      Circle being one and the Fosna culture from Trøndelag to

      >
      being the other) were rendered obsolete in the 1970s. More recent finds
      along the entire coast revealed to archaeologists that the difference
      between the two can simply be ascribed to different types of tools and not
      to different cultures. Coastal fauna provided a means of livelihood for
      fishermen and hunters, who may have made their way along the southern
      coast about 10,000 BC when the interior was still covered with ice. It is
      now thought that these so-called "Arctic" peoples came from the south and
      followed the coast northward considerably later. In the southern part of
      the country are dwelling sites dating from about 5,000 BC. Finds from
      these sites give a clearer idea of the life of the hunting and fishing
      peoples. The implements vary in shape and mostly are made of different
      kinds of stone; those of later periods are more skilfully made. Rock
      carvings (i.e. petroglyphs) have been found, usually near hunting and
      fishing grounds. They represent game such as deer, reindeer, elk, bears,
      birds, seals, whales, and fish (especially salmon and halibut), all of
      which were vital to the way of life of the coastal peoples. The rock
      carvings at Alta in Finnmark, the largest in Scandinavia, were made at sea
      level from 4,200 to 500 BC and mark the progression of the land as the sea
      rose after the last ice age ended.

      Norway's core territory comprises the western and northernmost portion of
      the Scandinavian Peninsula; the remote island of Jan Mayen and the
      archipelago of Svalbard are also part of the Kingdom of Norway.[note 1]
      The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are
      dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway
      also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land.[88]
      From the Middle Ages to 1814 Norway was part of the Danish kingdom.
      Norwegian possessions in the North Atlantic, Faroe Islands, Greenland, and
      Iceland, remained Danish when Norway was passed to Sweden at the Treaty of
      Kiel.[89] Norway also comprised Bohuslän until 1658, Jämtland and
      Härjedalen until 1645,[88] Shetland and Orkney until 1468,[90] and the
      Hebrides and Isle of Man until the Treaty of Perth in 1266.[91] Norway
      comprises the western and northernmost part of Scandinavia in Northern
      Europe.[92] Norway lies between latitudes 57° and 81° N, and longitudes 4°
      and 32° E. Norway is the northernmost of the Nordic countries and if
      Svalbard is included also the easternmost.[93] Vardø at 31° 10' 07" east
      of Greenwich lies further east than St. Petersburg and Istanbul.[94]
      Norway includes the northernmost point on the European mainland.[95] The
      rugged coastline is broken by huge fjords and thousands of islands. The
      coastal baseline is 2,532 kilometres (1,573 mi). The coastline of the
      mainland including fjords stretches 28,953 kilometres (17,991 mi), when
      islands are included the coastline has been estimated to 100,915
      kilometres (62,706 mi).[96] Norway shares a 1,619-kilometre (1,006 mi)
      land border with Sweden, 727 kilometres (452 mi) with
      <a href="https://finland.fi/" target="_blank" title="link to Finland"
        >Finland</a
      >, and 196 kilometres (122 mi) with Russia to the east. To the north, west
      and south, Norway is bordered by the Barents Sea, the Norwegian Sea, the
      North Sea, and Skagerrak.[97] The Scandinavian Mountains form much of the
      border with Sweden.

      The southern and western parts of Norway, fully exposed to Atlantic storm
      fronts, experience more precipitation and have milder winters than the
      eastern and far northern parts. Areas to the east of the coastal mountains
      are in a rain shadow, and have lower rain and snow totals than the west.
      The lowlands around Oslo have the warmest and sunniest summers, but also
      cold weather and snow in wintertime.[102][103] Sandefjord is a resort town
      which has Norway's highest number of annual cloud-free days.[104][105]
      Langeby Beach, 1966. Because of Norway's high latitude, there are large
      seasonal variations in daylight. From late May to late July, the sun never
      completely descends beneath the horizon in areas north of the
      <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_Norway"
        target="_blank"
        title="Artic circle link to wikipedia"
        >Arctic Circle</a
      >
      (hence Norway's description as the "Land of the Midnight sun"), and the
      rest of the country experiences up to 20 hours of daylight per day.
      Conversely, from late November to late January, the sun never rises above
      the horizon in the north, and daylight hours are very short in the rest of
      the country. The coastal climate of Norway is exceptionally mild compared
      with areas on similar latitudes elsewhere in the world, with the Gulf
      Stream passing directly offshore the northern areas of the Atlantic coast,
      continuously warming the region in the winter. Temperature anomalies found
      in coastal locations are exceptional, with Røst and Værøy lacking a
      meteorological winter in spite of being north of the Arctic Circle. The
      Gulf Stream has this effect only on the northern parts of Norway, not in
      the south, despite what is commonly believed. The northern coast of Norway
      would thus be ice-covered if not for the Gulf Stream.[106] As a
      side-effect, the Scandinavian Mountains prevent continental winds from
      reaching the coastline, causing very cool summers throughout Atlantic
      Norway. Oslo has more of a continental climate, similar to Sweden's. The
      mountain ranges have subarctic and tundra climates. There is also very
      high rainfall in areas exposed to the Atlantic, such as Bergen. Oslo, in
      comparison, is dry, being in a rain shadow. Skjåk in Oppland county is
      also in the rain shadow and is one of the driest places with 278
      millimetres (10.9 inches) precipitation annually. Finnmarksvidda and the
      interior valleys of <span id="Troms and Nordland">Troms and Nordland</span> also receive
      less than 300 millimetres (12 inches) annually. Longyearbyen is the driest
      place in Norway with 190 millimetres (7.5 inches).[107] Parts of
      southeastern Norway including parts of Mjøsa have warm-summer humid
      continental climates (Köppen Dfb), while the more southern and western
      coasts are mostly of the oceanic climate (Cfb). Further inland in
      southeastern and northern Norway, the subarctic climate (Dfc) dominates;
      this is especially true for areas in the rain shadow of the Scandinavian
      Mountains. Some of the inner valleys of Oppland get so little
      precipitation annually, thanks to the rain shadow effect, that they meet
      the requirements for dry-summer subarctic climates (Dsc). In higher
      altitudes, close to the coasts of southern and western Norway, one can
      find the rare subpolar oceanic climate (Cfc). This climate is also common
      in Northern Norway, usually in lower altitudes, all the way down to sea
      level. A small part of the northernmost coast of Norway has the
      tundra/alpine/polar climate (ET). Large parts of Norway are covered by
      mountains and high altitude plateaus, many of which also exhibit the
      tundra/alpine/polar climate (ET).
