<p>
 The Constitution of Romania is based on the constitution of France's Fifth Republic and was approved in a national referendum on 8 December 1991 and amended in October 2003 to bring it into conformity with EU legislation. The country is governed on the basis of a multi-party democratic system and the separation of powers between the legislative, executive and judicial branches. It is a semi-presidential republic where executive functions are held by both the government and the president.The latter is elected by popular vote for a maximum of two terms of five years and appoints the prime minister who in turn appoints the Council of Ministers. The legislative branch of the government, collectively known as the Parliament (residing at the Palace of the Parliament), consists of two chambers (Senate and Chamber of Deputies) whose members are elected every four years by simple plurality.

</p>
<p>The justice system is independent of the other branches of government and is made up of a hierarchical system of courts with the High Court of Cassation and Justice being the supreme court of Romania.There are also courts of appeal, county courts and local courts. The Romanian judicial system is strongly influenced by the French model, is based on civil law and is inquisitorial in nature. The Constitutional Court (Curtea Constituțională) is responsible for judging the compliance of laws and other state regulations with the constitution, which is the fundamental law of the country and can only be amended through a public referendum.Romania's 2007 entry into the EU has been a significant influence on its domestic policy, and including judicial reforms, increased judicial cooperation with other member states, and measures to combat corruption.

<h3 id="Foreign relations"class="headline">Foreign relations</h3>

<p>
    Since December 1989, Romania has pursued a policy of strengthening relations with the West in general, more specifically with the United States and the European Union, albeit with limited relations involving the Russian Federation. It joined the NATO on 29 March 2004, the European Union (EU) on 1 January 2007, while it joined the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in 1972, and is a founding member of the World Trade Organization.

In the past, recent governments have stated that one of their goals is to strengthen ties with and helping other countries (in particular Moldova, Ukraine, and Georgia) with the process of integration with the rest of the West.Romania has also made clear since the late 1990s that it supports NATO and EU membership for the democratic former Soviet republics in Eastern Europe and the Caucasus.Romania also declared its public support for Turkey, and Croatia joining the European Union
</p>

<p>
   Romania opted on 1 January 2007, to accede to the Schengen Area, and its bid to join was approved by the European Parliament in June 2011, but was rejected by the EU Council in September 2011. As of August 2019, its acceptance into the Schengen Area is hampered because the European Council has misgivings about Romania's adherence to the rule of law,[259] a fundamental principle of EU membership. 
</p>
<p>
  In December 2005, President Traian Băsescu and United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice signed an agreement that would allow a U.S. military presence at several Romanian facilities primarily in the eastern part of the country.In May 2009, Hillary Clinton, US Secretary of State, declared that "Romania is one of the most trustworthy and respectable partners of the USA.  
</p>

<h3 id="Military"class="headline">Military</h3>

<p>
  The Romanian Armed Forces consist of land, air, and naval forces led by a Commander-in-chief under the supervision of the Ministry of National Defence, and by the president as the Supreme Commander during wartime. The Armed Forces consist of approximately 15,000 civilians and 75,000 military personnel—45,800 for land, 13,250 for air, 6,800 for naval forces, and 8,800 in other fields.Total defence spending in 2007 accounted for 2.05% of total national GDP, or approximately US$2.9 billion, with a total of $11 billion spent between 2006 and 2011 for modernization and acquisition of new equipment.

The Air Force currently operates modernised Soviet MiG-21 Lancer fighters.[268] The Air Force purchased seven new C-27J Spartan tactical airlifters, while the Naval Forces acquired two modernised Type 22 frigates from the British Royal Navy.

Romania contributed troops to the international coalition in Afghanistan beginning in 2002, with a peak deployment of 1,600 troops in 2010 (which was the 4th largest contribution according to the US).Its combat mission in the country concluded in 2014. Romanian troops participated in the occupation of Iraq, reaching a peak of 730 soldiers before being slowly drawn down to 350 soldiers. Romania terminated its mission in Iraq and withdrew its last troops on 24 July 2009, among the last countries to do so. The frigate the Regele Ferdinand participated in the 2011 military intervention in Libya.

In December 2011, the Romanian Senate unanimously adopted the draft law ratifying the Romania-United States agreement signed in September of the same year that would allow the establishment and operation of a US land-based ballistic missile defence system in Romania as part of NATO's efforts to build a continental missile shield

<h3 id="Administrative divisions"class="headline">
    Administrative divisions
</h3>

<p>
   Romania is divided into 41 counties (județe, pronounced judetse) and the municipality of Bucharest. Each county is administered by a county council, responsible for local affairs, as well as a prefect responsible for the administration of national affairs at the county level. The prefect is appointed by the central government but cannot be a member of any political party. Each county is subdivided further into cities and communes, which have their own mayor and local council. There are a total of 320 cities and 2,861 communes in Romania.A total of 103 of the larger cities have municipality status, which gives them greater administrative power over local affairs. The municipality of Bucharest is a special case, as it enjoys a status on par to that of a county. It is further divided into six sectors[235]:6 and has a prefect, a general mayor (primar), and a general city council.

The NUTS-3 (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics) level divisions of the European Union reflect Romania's administrative-territorial structure and correspond to the 41 counties plus Bucharest.The cities and communes correspond to the NUTS-5 level divisions, but there are no current NUTS-4 level divisions. The NUTS-1 (four macroregions) and NUTS-2(eight development regions) divisions exist but have no administrative capacity and are used instead for coordinating regional development projects and statistical purposes

<h2 id="Economy"class="headline">Economy</h2>

<p>
    In 2019, Romania has a GDP (PPP) of around $547 billion and a GDP per capita (PPP) of $28,189.[282] According to the World Bank, Romania is a high-income economy.[16] According to Eurostat, Romania's GDP per capita (PPS) was 69% of the EU average (100%) in 2019, an increase from 44% in 2007 (the year of Romania's accession to the EU), making Romania one of the fastest growing economies in the EU.
</p>
<p>
    After 1989 the country experienced a decade of economic instability and decline, led in part by an obsolete industrial base and a lack of structural reform. From 2000 onward, however, the Romanian economy was transformed into one of relative macroeconomic stability, characterized by high growth, low unemployment and declining inflation. In 2006, according to the Romanian Statistics Office, GDP growth in real terms was recorded at 7.7%, one of the highest rates in Europe.[284] However, a recession following the global financial crisis of 2008–2009 forced the government to borrow externally, including an IMF €20 billion bailout program.[285] According to The World Bank, GDP per capita in purchasing power parity grew from $13,687 in 2007 to $28,206 in 2018.[286] Romania's net average monthly wage increased to 666 euro as of 2020,[287] and an inflation rate of −1.1% in 2016.[288] Unemployment in Romania was at 4.3% in August 2018, which is low compared to other EU countries.
</p>

<p>Industrial output growth reached 6.5% year-on-year in February 2013, the highest in the Europe.[290] The largest local companies include car maker Automobile Dacia, Petrom, Rompetrol, Ford Romania, Electrica, Romgaz, RCS & RDS and Banca Transilvania.As of 2020, there are around 6000 exports per month. Romania's main exports are: cars, software, clothing and textiles, industrial machinery, electrical and electronic equipment, metallurgic products, raw materials, military equipment, pharmaceuticals, fine chemicals, and agricultural products (fruits, vegetables, and flowers). Trade is mostly centred on the member states of the European Union, with Germany and Italy being the country's single largest trading partners. The account balance in 2012 was estimated to be 4.52% of GDP</p>


<p>
    After a series of privatizations and reforms in the late 1990s and 2000s, government intervention in the Romanian economy is somewhat less than in other European economies.In 2005, the government replaced Romania's progressive tax system with a flat tax of 16% for both personal income and corporate profit, among the lowest rates in the European Union.[294] The economy is based predominantly on services, which account for 56.2% of the country's total GDP as of 2017, with industry and agriculture accounting for 30% and 4.4% respectively.[295] Approximately 25.8% of the Romanian workforce is employed in agriculture, one of the highest rates in Europe.
</p>

<p>
    Romania has attracted increasing amounts of foreign investment following the end of Communism, with the stock of foreign direct investment (FDI) in Romania rising to €83.8 billion in June 2019.Romania's FDI outward stock (an external or foreign business either investing in or purchasing the stock of a local economy) amounted to $745 million in December 2018, the lowest value among the 28 EU member states
</p>

<p>According to a 2019 World Bank report, Romania ranks 52nd out of 190 economies in the ease of doing business, one place higher than neighbouring Hungary and one place lower than Italy.The report praised the consistent enforcement of contracts and access to credit in the country, while noting difficulties in access to electricity and dealing with construction permits.</p>

<p>
    Since 1867 the official currency has been the Romanian leu ("lion") and following a denomination in 2005.After joining the EU in 2007, Romania is expected to adopt the Euro in 2024.
</p>

<h3 id="Infrastructure"class="headline">Infrastructure</h3>

<p>
    According to the Romania's National Institute of Statistics (INSSE), Romania's total road network was estimated in 2015 at 86,080 kilometres (53,488 mi).The World Bank estimates the railway network at 22,298 kilometres (13,855 mi) of track, the fourth-largest railroad network in Europe.Romania's rail transport experienced a dramatic decline after 1989 and was estimated at 99 million passenger journeys in 2004, but has experienced a recent (2013) revival due to infrastructure improvements and partial privatisation of lines,accounting for 45% of all passenger and freight movements in the country.Bucharest Metro, the only underground railway system, was opened in 1979 and measures 61.41 km (38.16 mi) with an average ridership in 2007 of 600,000 passengers during the workweek in the country.[304] There are sixteen international commercial airports in service today. Over 12.8 million passengers flew through Bucharest's Henri Coandă International Airport in 2017
</p>

<p>
   Romania is a net exporter of electrical energy and is 52nd worldwide in terms of consumption of electric energy.Around a third of the produced energy comes from renewable sources, mostly as hydroelectric power.In 2015, the main sources were coal (28%), hydroelectric (30%), nuclear (18%), and hydrocarbons (14%).[308] It has one of the largest refining capacities in Eastern Europe, even though oil and natural gas production has been decreasing for more than a decade.[309] With one of the largest reserves of crude oil and shale gas in Europe[310] it is among the most energy-independent countries in the European Union,and is looking to expand its nuclear power plant at Cernavodă further. 
</p>

<p>
   There were almost 18.3 million connections to the Internet in June 2014.According to Bloomberg, in 2013 Romania ranked <strong>fifth in the world</strong>, and according to The Independent, it ranks<strong>number one in Europe at Internet speeds</strong> ,with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=886Ait8ktug&ab_channel=EYEINTHESKY.ro"><strong>Timișoara</strong></a> ranked among the highest in the world. <span><strong>amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing</strong></span><span>amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing</span>

<h3 id="Tourism"class="headline">Tourism</h3>

<p>
    Tourism is a significant contributor to the Romanian economy, generating around 5% of GDP.The number of tourists has been rising steadily, reaching 9.33 million foreign tourists in 2016, according to the Worldbank.[318] Tourism in Romania attracted €400 million in investments in 2005.More than 60% of the foreign visitors in 2007 were from other EU countries.[320] The popular summer attractions of Mamaia and other Black Sea Resorts attracted 1.3 million tourists in 2009
</p>
<p>
    Most popular skiing resorts are along the Valea Prahovei and in Poiana Brașov. Castles, fortifications, or strongholds as well as preserved medieval Transylvanian cities or towns such as Cluj-Napoca, Sibiu, Brașov, Bistrița, Mediaș, Cisnădie, or Sighișoara also attract a large number of tourists. Bran Castle, near Brașov, is one of the most famous attractions in Romania, drawing hundreds of thousands of tourists every year as it is often advertised as being Dracula's Castle.
</p>

<p>
Rural tourism, focusing on folklore and traditions, has become an important alternative,and is targeted to promote such sites as Bran and its Dracula's Castle, the painted churches of northern Moldavia, and the wooden churches of Maramureș, or the villages with fortified churches in Transylvania.Other attractions include the Danube Delta or the Sculptural Ensemble of Constantin Brâncuși at Târgu Jiu.

</p>
In 2014, Romania had 32,500 companies active in the hotel and restaurant industry, with a total turnover of €2.6 billion.More than 1.9 million foreign tourists visited Romania in 2014, 12% more than in 2013.[329] According to the country's National Statistics Institute, some 77% came from Europe (particularly from Germany, Italy, and France), 12% from Asia, and less than 7% from North America.

<p>
   Historically, Romanian researchers and inventors have made notable contributions to several fields. In the history of flight, Traian Vuia built the first airplane to take off under its own power and Aurel Vlaicu built and flew some of the earliest successful aircraft,[331] while Henri Coandă discovered the Coandă effect of fluidics.[332] Victor Babeș discovered more than 50 types of bacteria;[333] biologist Nicolae Paulescu discovered insulin,[334] while Emil Palade received the Nobel Prize for his contributions to cell biology.Lazăr Edeleanu was the first chemist to synthesise amphetamine, and he also invented the procedure of separating valuable petroleum components with selective solvents.[ 
</p>

<p>
   During the 1990s and 2000s, the development of research was hampered by several factors, including: corruption, low funding, and a considerable brain drain.In recent years, Romania has ranked the lowest or second-lowest in the European Union by research and development spending as a percentage of GDP, standing at roughly 0.5% in 2016 and 2017, substantially below the EU average of just over 2%.The country joined the European Space Agency (ESA) in 2011,[340] and CERN in 2016.[341] In 2018, however, Romania lost its voting rights in the ESA due to a failure to pay €56.8 million in membership contributions to the agency.
</p>

<p>
   In the early 2010s, the situation for science in Romania was characterised as "rapidly improving" albeit from a low base.In January 2011, Parliament passed a law that enforces "strict quality control on universities and introduces tough rules for funding evaluation and peer review".[344]

The nuclear physics facility of the European Union's proposed Extreme Light Infrastructure (ELI) laser will be built in Romania.In early 2012, Romania launched its first satellite from the Centre Spatial Guyanais in French Guyana.[346] Starting in December 2014, Romania became a co-owner of the International Space Station.

<h2 id="Demographics" class="headline">Demographics</h2>

<p>
    According to the 2011 census, Romania's population is 20,121,641.Like other countries in the region, its population is expected to decline gradually in the coming years as a result of sub-replacement fertility rates and negative net migration rate. In October 2011, Romanians made up 88.9% of the population. The largest ethnic minorities are the Hungarians, 6.1% of the population, and the Roma, 3.0% of the population.The Roma minority is usually underestimated in census data and may represent up to 10% of the population.Hungarians constitute a majority in the counties of Harghita and Covasna. Other minorities include Ukrainians, Germans, Turks, Lipovans, Aromanians, Tatars, and Serbs.In 1930, there were 745,421 Germans living in Romania,but only about 36,000 remained in the country to this day.As of 2009, there were also approximately 133,000 immigrants living in Romania, primarily from Moldova and China.[
</p>

<p>
    The total fertility rate (TFR) in 2018 was estimated at 1.36 children born per woman, which is below the replacement rate of 2.1, and one of the lowest in the world,it remains considerably below the high of 5.82 children born per woman in 1912.In 2014, 31.2% of births were to unmarried women.The birth rate (9.49‰, 2012) is much lower than the mortality rate (11.84‰, 2012), resulting in a shrinking (−0.26% per year, 2012) and aging population (median age: 41.6 years, 2018), one of the oldest populations in the world,with approximately 16.8% of total population aged 65 years and over.The life expectancy in 2015 was estimated at 74.92 years (71.46 years male, 78.59 years female).The number of Romanians and individuals with ancestors born in Romania living abroad is estimated at around 12 million.[358] After the Romanian Revolution of 1989, a significant number of Romanians emigrated to other European countries, North America or Australia.For example, in 1990, 96,919 Romanians permanently settled abroad.
</p>

<h3 id="Languages"class="headline">Languages</h3>

<p>
    The official language is Romanian, a Romance language (the most widely spoken of the Eastern Romance branch), which presents a consistent degree of similarity to Aromanian, Megleno-Romanian, and Istro-Romanian, but shares many features equally with the rest of the Western Romance languages, specifically Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Catalan.[361] The Romanian alphabet contains the same 26 letters of the standard Latin alphabet, as well as five additional ones (namely 'ă','â','î','ț', and 'ș'), totaling 31.
</p>

<p>
    Romanian is spoken as a first language by approximately 90% of the entire population, while Hungarian and Vlax Romani are spoken by 6.2% and 1.2% of the population, respectively. There are also approximately 50,000 native speakers of Ukrainian (concentrated in some compact regions, near the border where they form local majorities),25,000 native speakers of German, and 32,000 native speakers of Turkish living in Romania.
</p>

<p>
    According to the Constitution, local councils ensure linguistic rights to all minorities, with localities with ethnic minorities of over 20%, that minority's language can be used in the public administration, justice system, and education. Foreign citizens and stateless persons who live in Romania have access to justice and education in their own language.[364] English and French are the main foreign languages taught in schools.In 2010, the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie identified 4,756,100 French speakers in the country.[366] According to the 2012 Eurobarometer, English is spoken by 31% of Romanians, French is spoken by 17%, as well as Italian and German, each by 7%
</p>

<h3 id="Religion"class="headline">Religion</h3>

<p>
    Romania is a secular state and has no state religion. An overwhelming majority of the population identify themselves as Christians. At the country's 2011 census, 81.0% of respondents identified as Orthodox Christians belonging to the Romanian Orthodox Church. Other denominations include Protestantism (6.2%), Roman Catholicism (4.3%), and Greek Catholicism (0.8%). From the remaining population, 195,569 people belong to other Christian denominations or have another religion, which includes 64,337 Muslims (mostly of Turkish and Tatar ethnicity) and 3,519 Jewish (Jews once constituted 4% of the Romanian population—728,115 persons in the 1930 census). Moreover, 39,660 people have no religion or are atheist, whilst the religion of the rest is unknown.[
</p>

<p>
  The Romanian Orthodox Church is an autocephalous Eastern Orthodox Church in full communion with other Orthodox churches, with a Patriarch as its leader. It is the fourth-largest Orthodox Church in the world,[368] and unlike other Orthodox churches, it functions within a Latin culture and utilises a Romance liturgical language.[369] Its canonical jurisdiction covers the territories of Romania and Moldova.  
</p>

<h3 id="Urbanisation"class="headline">Urbanisation</h3>

<p>
    Although 54.0% of the population lived in urban areas in 2011,this percentage has been declining since 1996.Counties with over ⅔  urban population are Hunedoara, Brașov and Constanța, while those with less than a third are Dâmbovița (30.06%) and Giurgiu and Teleorman.Bucharest is the capital and the largest city in Romania, with a population of over 1.8 million in 2011. Its larger urban zone has a population of almost 2.2 million,which are planned to be included into a metropolitan area up to 20 times the area of the city proper.Another 19 cities have a population of over 100,000, with Cluj-Napoca and Timișoara of slightly more than 300,000 inhabitants, Iași, Constanța, Craiova, and Brașov with over 250,000 inhabitants, and Galați and Ploiești with over 200,000 inhabitants.Metropolitan areas have been constituted for most of these cities.
</p>

<h3 id="Education"class="headline">Education</h3>

<p>
    Since the Romanian Revolution of 1989, the Romanian educational system has been in a continuous process of reform that has received mixed criticism.In 2004, some 4.4 million individuals were enrolled in school. Of these, 650,000 were in kindergarten (three-six years), 3.11 million in primary and secondary level, and 650,000 in tertiary level (universities).In 2018, the adult literacy rate was 98.8%.[380] Kindergarten is optional between three and six years. Since 2012, compulsory schooling starts at age 6 with the "preparatory school year" (clasa pregătitoare)and is compulsory until tenth grade.Primary and secondary education is divided into 12 or 13 grades. There is also a semi-legal, informal private tutoring system used mostly during secondary school, which prospered during the Communist regime.

    Romania ranks fifth in the all-time medal count at the International Mathematical Olympiad with 316 total medals, dating back to 1959. Ciprian Manolescu managed to write a perfect paper (42 points) for a gold medal more times than anybody else in the history of the competition, in 1995, 1996 and 1997.[385] Romania has achieved the highest team score in the competition, after China, Russia, the United States and Hungary. Romania also ranks sixth in the all-time medal count at the International Olympiad in Informatics with 107 total medals, dating back to 1989.

<h3 id="Healthcare" class="headline">Healthcare</h3>

<p>
   Romania has a universal health care system; total health expenditures by the government are roughly 5% of GDP.It covers medical examinations, any surgical interventions, and any post-operative medical care, and provides free or subsidised medicine for a range of diseases. The state is obliged to fund public hospitals and clinics. The most common causes of death are cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Transmissible diseases are quite common by European standards.[390] In 2010, Romania had 428 state and 25 private hospitals,[391] with 6.2 hospital beds per 1,000 people,[392] and over 200,000 medical staff, including over 52,000 doctors.[393] As of 2013, the emigration rate of doctors was 9%, higher than the European average of 2.5%.
